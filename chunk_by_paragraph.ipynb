      "the previous experiments mostly examine rnns on nlp tasks whose lengths are in the range of 10 to 40. to show the effectiveness of layer normalization on longer sequences, we performed hand- writing generation tasks using the iam online handwriting database [liwicki and bunke, 2005]. iam-ondb consists of handwritten lines collected from 221 different writers. when given the input character string, the goal is to predict a sequence of x and y pen co-ordinates of the corresponding handwriting line on the whiteboard. there are, in total, 12179 handwriting line sequences. the input string is typically more than 25 characters and the average handwriting line has a length around 700. we used the same model architecture as in section (5.2) of graves [2013]. the model architecture consists of three hidden layers of 400 lstm cells, which produce 20 bivariate gaussian mixture components at the output layer, and a size 3 input layer. the character sequence was encoded with one-hot vectors, and hence the window vectors were size 57. a mixture of 10 gaussian functions was used for the window parameters, requiring a size 30 parameter vector. the total number of weights was increased to approximately 3.7m. the model is trained using mini-batches of size 8 and the adam [kingma and ba, 2014] optimizer.\n",

      "\n",
      "in addition to rnns, we investigated layer normalization in feed-forward networks. we show how layer normalization compares with batch normalization on the well-studied permutation invariant mnist classiﬁcation problem. from the previous analysis, layer normalization is invariant to input re-scaling which is desirable for the internal hidden layers. but this is unnecessary for the logit outputs where the prediction conﬁdence is determined by the scale of the logits. we only apply layer normalization to the fully-connected hidden layers that excludes the last softmax layer. all the models were trained using 55000 training data points and the adam [kingma and ba, 2014] optimizer. for the smaller batch-size, the variance term for batch normalization is computed using the unbiased estimator. the experimental results from figure 6 highlight that layer normalization is robust to the batch-sizes and exhibits a faster training convergence comparing to batch normalization that is applied to all layers.\n",
      "\n",
      "we have also experimented with convolutional neural networks. in our preliminary experiments, we observed that layer normalization offers a speedup over the baseline model without normalization, but batch normalization outperforms the other methods. with fully connected layers, all the hidden units in a layer tend to make similar contributions to the ﬁnal prediction and re-centering and re- scaling the summed inputs to a layer works well. however, the assumption of similar contributions is no longer true for convolutional neural networks. the large number of the hidden units whose receptive ﬁelds lie near the boundary of the image are rarely turned on and thus have very different statistics from the rest of the hidden units within the same layer. we think further research is needed to make layer normalization work well in convnets.\n",
